Introduction
------------
This is a Spring template for using unit tests with JUnit 4
and integration tests with Jetty and HtmlUnit.
pom.xml shows how to run unit tests, then exclude them from
the integration test phase while running jetty before the
integration tests start and shutting it down when they've
finished.
All tests are run from the command:
mvn clean install

Running the template
--------------------
You can see the template in action by running Jetty:
mvn jetty:run
and pointing your browser to:
http://localhost:8080/spring-template
