Introduction
------------
This is a set of small, minimalist Spring web applications, each one
showing how to do a specific thing in Spring. Each template has just
the right amount of clutter in its pom.xml to work.

Templates
---------
Each template is held in a git branch:

master - Simple web application with two views. A simple view and one that
         shows how to display Model attributes in a view.
with-logging - The master web application but with log4j logging added to the
               controller.
